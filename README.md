# Diabetes-Predictor
A group of metabolic disorders known as diabetes are characterised by persistently high blood sugar levels. Diabetes has a number of complications that can develop if untreated. Among the serious long-term side effects are heart disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, and eye damage.

Today, diabetes is one of the most common, chronic, and, due to some complications, deadliest diseases in the world. The early detection of diabetes is very important for its timely treatment since it can stop the progression of the disease.

This model helps the user to estimate the likelihood of having diabetes.



## Objective
It is a Deep Learning model that has been trained to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes based on specific diagnostic measurements provided by the user.
## Details about input data:
- Number of times pregnant

- Tricep skin fold thickness (mm)
- 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
